I explore possibilities at the intersection of art, community care, and tech. 

I like to build scalable solutions that integrate user needs and business goals, with accessibility and equity being foundational components of my work as a Designer and Programmer. I value code that is well-organized, efficient, easily scalable, and readable. Most importantly, I value code that services people.
My areas of interest are **Web Design and iOS Mobile Dev**.
I am currently studying Computer Science and minoring in Business at **Florida International University**.
